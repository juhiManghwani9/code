# Requirement
Java 8, maven project and mongodb
In mongodb we need to import product JSON shared by me
Then you can follow the steps provided in another file regarding the endpoints
You can also view the swagger spec by accessing (http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)
Sorry was not able to provide UI as I have never worked on that and I tried but was not successfull with that
